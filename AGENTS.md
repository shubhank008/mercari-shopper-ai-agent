# Agent Operations & Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Guide

**Agent Identity:** You are an autonomous coding agent operating within an OpenHands environment. Your primary objective is to execute Spec-Driven Development (SDD).

> This file is read automatically by Coding Agent at the start of every session.
> It is the highest-leverage file in the repo: everything here is context the
> agent gets for free, and everything not here has to be rediscovered -- usually
> by breaking something first. Keep the **Architecture invariants** section and add to it.

## Working Rules

- Plan in the main session, together with me. Hand grunt work (broad searches,
  repetitive edits, boilerplate, log digging) to subagents on lesser models.
  Keep decisions, architecture, and final review in the main session.
- Always look for the simplest solution first, and prefer it. The smallest
  change that solves the actual problem beats a bigger design. Extend existing
  patterns before inventing new ones. No new dependencies or moving parts
  without a real reason.
- Show me a checklist while you work (use the todo list tool), kept current,
  so I can see what you are working on, what is done, and what is next.
- When you spawn a subagent, tell me at that moment: which model it runs on
  and what it is doing. Report what it came back with when it finishes.
- After dispatching a delegated subagent, verify once that its conversation was
  created, is running, has the expected model/tools, and has no immediate error.
  Then stop. Do not poll or wait for completion; the user will announce when the
  subagent finishes, at which point the main agent evaluates its report and diff.
- Never use Haiku.
- Do not use em-dashes or emojis. Comment every method and important code. Maintain up-to-date documentation so a new developer can easily takeover. English everywhere.
- Plan ahead using a PLAN.md and keep it updated after every feature or update.
- **When something surprises you, write it down here.** A landmine that costs
  an hour and is not recorded costs that hour again.
- **Three-strike rule:** For the same terminal command, test target, or compilation
  block, three consecutive failures end that attempt. A fourth variation is forbidden
  without first changing the strategy.
- **Mandatory pivot:** After the third consecutive failure, stop the current approach,
  preserve the failure output, inspect `git status` and `git diff`, restore only files
  changed by the failed attempt, explain the failure, and choose a materially different
  programmatic strategy. Never use a blanket `git checkout` or `git restore` that could
  erase pre-existing user work.
- **No dependency rabbit holes:** Do not repeatedly patch or work around a broken
  sub-dependency. After confirming the dependency is the source of failure, prefer a
  simpler native or already-supported project path and record the dependency limitation.

## Isolated worktree protocol

- The repository-root checkout is the main session's coordination checkout. Any
  sub-chat or delegated Plan/Task that reads or modifies repository files must use
  its own worktree, except for a pure discussion that does not touch files.
- Before dispatching the sub-chat, fetch the latest base and create a unique branch
  and worktree from `origin/main`, for example:
  `git fetch origin && git worktree add -b feat/<scope> .worktrees/<scope> origin/main`.
- Pass the sub-chat the absolute worktree path and branch name. All implementation,
  tests, commits, and publication preparation must happen in that worktree. A
  sub-chat must not switch branches or edit the main session's checkout.
- Inspect the root checkout's status before dispatching and preserve its existing
  user edits. Worktrees created from `origin/main` intentionally exclude dirty root
  changes unless the main session explicitly decides otherwise.
- Use one worktree and branch per concurrent sub-chat or milestone. The main session
  independently reviews the worktree diff and verification evidence before merging
  through the `/no-mistakes` PR workflow.
- After a branch is merged, fetch the remote, synchronize the main checkout, and
  remove the clean worktree. Delete the local branch only when it is no longer
  needed for recovery or reference.

## Where code lives

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `docs/specs/` | One directory per feature: spec + plan + marker contract |
| `.agents/skills/` | The skills below. Read the one that matches before writing code |

## Which skill, when

Invoke the skill **before** writing the code, not after it breaks.

| Reach for | When |
|-----------|------|
| `/sdd-feature` | Starting any feature, ability, item, or system. The gated loop |
| `/no-mistakes` | Pushing to GIT or Generating PR for anything to the GIT repo |

## 1. The Autonomous State Machine

You must strictly follow this lifecycle for every feature or bug fix without human intervention:

* **Think:** Analyze the `SPEC.md`, current feature request, and existing codebase.
* **Research:** Map out the required abstract interfaces and API payloads.
* **Plan:** Generate a step-by-step implementation checklist.
* **Build:** Write the code. You must implement abstract classes before writing concrete integrations.
* **Test:** Run the gatekeeper scripts. If tests fail, diagnose and loop back to the Build phase.
* **Document:** Update inline documentation and the overall API specs.
* **Publish:** Commit the changes using semantic commit messages.

## Gatekeeping & Testing Rules

* **Strict Gatekeeping:** Code cannot be published unless it passes linting and type checking.
* **Unit Testing:** Every concrete class (e.g., `KokoroTTSProvider`) must have a corresponding unit test isolating its methods.
* **E2E Mock Testing:** You must write and utilize tests that simulate a human interacting with the platform. This involves programmatically replicating the human-user experience from start to finish, without needing to test using a real browser or playwright.
* **Abstract First:** Never hardcode a third-party service directly into the business logic. Always route through an interface (e.g., `BaseSTT`, `BaseDataStore`).

## Workflow

New features follow the SDD loop -- invoke `/sdd-feature` when starting one:
spec → plan → **marker contract** → implement → **evidence** → **landmine**.
The last three arrows are the ones that catch this engine: the contract is
written before the code, the evidence is a frame and not a log line for
anything visual, and a surprise that cost an hour gets appended to the
invariants below before the feature closes.

A feature typically walks: `/sdd-feature` → actual feature implementation → test → focused commits → `/no-mistakes`.

### Commit and publish protocol

* Every feature or major change must be split into focused, semantic commits. Keep specifications, plans, contracts, implementation slices, tests, documentation, and cleanup separately traceable when they are independently meaningful.
  Do not collapse a feature's entire lifecycle into one oversized commit.
* The agent that completes a feature owns its final publication steps: inspect the worktree, commit all intended changes, invoke `/no-mistakes`, and drive the gate through push, PR, and CI monitoring. Do not finish with uncommitted feature work.
* Never push to repo directly. `/no-mistakes` is the only path for publishing a branch or generating a pull request. Whenever you need to PUSH or user asks to PUSH, invoke `/no-mistakes`.
* After a pipeline-created fix commit, synchronize the local branch with the pipeline-published head before reporting completion.

### Autonomous gate decisions

* A no-mistakes run must not stall waiting for the user at an ordinary review, lint, documentation, test, or CI decision gate. The agent must inspect the finding, apply the smallest safe fix when appropriate, or affirmatively approve/skip it according to the configured intent, then continue monitoring.
* Ask the user only when proceeding requires a genuinely ambiguous product, privacy, security, destructive, or authorization decision that cannot be resolved from the specification. Record the reason for the escalation in the final report.

## Architecture invariants

Each of these describes a real failure, hurdle or constraint of this project. Violate one and you will spend hours looking in the wrong
place.
